Dear Project Memebers.

This file is included specifically for the first git commit.
 If you are not From our University Project. Move along Nothing to see here.
 As for you lazy bastards. This is meant for you to speculate. So that you don't fuck up during
 questions and and answers.
 The comment in lapsipc are quite sparse. It's beacuse it will change rapidly and comment are irrelevant
 Also if you have time learn and comment

SUMMARY:
 lapsipc.c:
 lapsipc.c is for creating a fifo and communicating with python
 It creates a fifo see 'man 7 fifo' in terminal
 Functions such as open read are documented in linux. And function starting
 from g for e.g  g_io_add_watch() is a glib function to call the given call back function
 on the given occasion. Here it call the input callback to fetch the data if there is data to fetch

 lapsi-backend.c:
 This opens the window and gstreamer element. It is commented fairly Enough
 I have modified this file written for old version of gtk and gstreamer
 http://docs.gstreamer.com/display/GstSDK/Basic+tutorial+5%3A+GUI+toolkit+integration
 for our use and to be compiled by gstreamer-1.0 and gtk+-3.0.


 main.py
 It is similar to lapsipc and is commented anyway.


 makefile
 learn about the gnu make. It's Just something to make compilation easier
 http://mrbook.org/tutorials/make/


 dependencies
 gtk+-3.0 gstreamer-1.0 gstreamer-1.0*
 USE APT-GET !! USE APT-GET !!


 TODO:
  This is bare bone of what we what we want to do.
  1.Create a basic player in c. >>>>>This is done(almost)
  2.Create a IPC(InterProcessCommunication) structure. >>>>>> We managed to pass a string. back and forth
  3.Write a API to extend the basic player in c using python.
  >>>>Elaboration of Number 3:
    for example you want a function named play in python.
    i. define a function named play in c.
    ii. the function passes string "play" to our c player.
    iii. c catches the "play" string and calls function play.
  4.Gtk Sockets and GTK plugs
  >>>>Google it.

Trying to Use:
 You must have all dependencies installed.
 run
 make pyexec >>>>>>Do only once and you are set.
 make
 make clean >>>>Clean the object files.

If You truly care to compile you will have to google a lot. I mean a LOT. Don't be scared.
The media file will only play you have correct plugins installed but the compiling must be easy.

Good Day:
If you have any questions. Don't ask me. :D.
JK. See you.
WHY AM I WRITING THIS YOU ARE NOT SEEING THIS ANYWAY.
